## building
To build, run build.sh or build.bat depending on your OS, after that if everything worked correctly, the built exec should be in bin/.
BTW for unix a completion script is available for zsh: 
```sh
source completion.zsh
```

## NOTE:
I haven't tested this on windows, i mean I have, but don't have the chance to very often.
So if you're trying to build on windows, just know that it MAY or MAY NOT actually work.
